#         Inputs:
#         - song_database: List[dict] specifies that song_database is a list of dictionaries 
#         (assuming each song is represented as a dictionary with details like title, artist, and duration).
#         - min_duration and max_duration is the range in which the playlist can fall in. e.g. a playlist is 15 minutes 
#         we might want the playlist to fall between 14 1/2 to 15 1/2 minutes
