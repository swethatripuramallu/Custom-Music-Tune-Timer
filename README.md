# Custom-Music-Tune-Timer
## Overview

Our proposed project for open-source software senior design is called Tune Timer. This would be a mobile application available for Apple devices that would link with a user’s Spotify account to generate a playlist that is attuned to their listening history and is the exact length of time they specify.

This idea was formed as many of our peers set timers for certain amounts of time while studying, cleaning their room, working out, taking breaks, etc. These tasks can be more enjoyable with music playing in the background. Our team aims to combine these two needs into a fun and practical application.

Our application would start by having users connect to their Spotify account. Once this step is completed, they will have the ability to generate a custom playlist. Users will input a duration for their timer and will have the option to select a mood or activity that represents how they are currently feeling or what they are doing. Our application will then generate a playlist for the inputted time of songs based on their listening history and that matches their mood/activity. At the end of the playlist, an alert sound will go off to notify users that the playlist is over and the amount of time they input has expired.

Another feature we hope to implement in the future for our application is the ability for users to provide feedback on the created playlists. Users will be able to like or dislike songs within their playlist which will be returned to their Spotify account. This will allow disliked songs to not appear in our application’s playlists as well as not be played on their Spotify account. It will also allow liked songs to appear more frequently and be easy to find on their Spotify account for later listening.

Our team believes the most difficult engineering problem for this application will be determining which songs both match the users' listening history and fit the mood or activity they input. We plan to use their Spotify listening history to generate a list of any song that they may enjoy listening to and then filter that list down based on the perceived mood of the song. For example, for a workout playlist, we would include songs with a faster tempo. While we believe ensuring that this feature is accurate will be complicated, we believe it is an important part of our application that helps differentiate it from possible competitors.
